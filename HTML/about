<h1> Hi, I'm Ethan!
    Over the past 4 years, I've built my sports photo and video portfolio through freelance and team-based environments on the high school, collegiate, and professional levels. I'm currently studying ADPR at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and am involved with the creative media department for all of Husker Athletics. 
    I love what I do.
    Whether it's a documentary project showing the unique struggles and traits of an individual, or a fast-paced highlight tape that excites and captivates, I have truly fallen in love with the craft of creative media.
    So if I ever have the pleasure of joining your team or directing a project for your brand, just know that I take pride in my work, and in your decision to choose me.
    Thank you for reading and don't be afraid to reach out with any questions or inquiries!
    Best,
    Ethan </h1>
